Website must be full-stack developer.

Website Purpose:
1.  Website has to be related to Car Sales, Moto Bikes sales, Bicycle Sales, Apartment sales, drone, air conditioner, table fan, Alarm Clock, sunglass, lipstick, nail polish etc.

2. Make sure your design and website idea is unique. Visit themeforest to get your website idea.

3. Start working on the project. If needed, put a placeholder image and keep developing the functionalities. Once the functionality is done, come back to add proper images.


Task_Details:
1. Home page will have a header, banner, products, reviews, and footer. On the home page, the products will have a maximum of 6 items/products. You can put one or more products in a row based on your design. 

2. Add one extra section in the home page in addition to the 5 sections mentioned above.

3. We will have another page on the top navigation bar (header) mentioning explore (you can give it a meaningful name based on your website). Clicking on the link will take the user to the explore page. 

4.  The purchase page should display detailed information of the item the user has clicked somewhere at the top. It will also display the user's name and email address from the login system and the user will have a field to provide address, phone number and necessary information to place the order or to complete the purchase.

5. Implement email/ password (login/Register) based login system. The registration form should have the name and once a user is logged in, the user name, and the logout button should appear on the header which will log out the user once clicked.

6. If a user is logged in, he/she will see another option on the header is called Dashboard and inside that dashboard a normal user (not an admin) will see options like pay,My Orders, Review, Logout. Based on your website idea, you can change the name of these menu items. The pay page will say: Payment system coming soon.

7. On the my orders page, the logged in user will see only his/her orders. If the user wants, he/she should be able to cancel/delete any order. Ask a confirmation message before deleting or canceling an item. Using browser confirmation dialog is ok.


8. If an admin logs in, he/she will not see the options that a normal user sees. Insted an admin will see Manage All Orders, Add A Product, Make Admin, Manage Products Logout. Based on your website idea, you can change the name of these menu items. Details about Manage all orders or Manage products will be provided later.

9. An Admin should be able to make another user an admin. If an admin wants, he/she will be able to add a product on the add a product page. After adding the product, this product will appear on the explore page.
